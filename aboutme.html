	<h1> About Me</h1>
	
	<h3>    
Ray A. Tenorio was born in La Habana, Cuba. After 3 years of study Social Communication at Universidad 
de La Habana, he moved to USA where completed his Associate’s degree in Graphic and Commercial 
Arts at Miami Dade College. While doing his Associate’s degree on Art, Ray went to study in 
		Germany Illustration Design at AID Berlin.</h3>
<h3>
Ray lives in Miami, USA. He began freelancing as designer even before completed his studies. 
	Despites of his design jobs, his illustrations are considered Art.</h3>
<h3>
Most of his work is influenced by Latin roots, Pop Art, urban mythology and fashion. He brings a 
	fresh and unique way to incorporate all these elements in one piece.</h3>
<h3>
	In his own words:</h3>
	<h3>
"I’m an Illustrator designer who love the idea of synergy. 
Fascinated with surrealism and the way we people interact 
with art. I love to create a conversation between my 
illustrations and the audience, not a direct one, but a soul
deep dialogue. Beauty, sensuality, abstraction and joy is part
of my work. I invite you all to be part of my fairytale world."
