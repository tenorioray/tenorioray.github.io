	<h1> About Me</h1>
	
	<h3>I am a current Graphic Design student at Miami International University of Art and Design (MIA). My interest is forward to make the best use of my skills and knowledge obtained at MIA. In addition, I must mention that I did two full years at Miami Dade College under the Graphics and Commercial Arts major, plus three full years at Havana University enrolled in the major of Social Communications.
The use of Adobe Cloud (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Dreamweaver) have become extremely familiar.
I enjoy working in a creative team, and I have the ability to communicate well with clients, colleagues and others.
